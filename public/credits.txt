## The Creation Story

If you have found this page, then congrats! You're a nosy bastard who likes looking under the hood and kicking the tires in. I bet you've brought your own dipstick as well. 

How did I craft this glorious monument to hubris, I hear you ask? Originally, I had heard of this nifty static site generator called Hugo (https://gohugo.io). It was pretty cool! It was dead easy to get up and running, had a nice templating syntax. Beautiful. Easy. I picked a nice theme (Aafu, by Darshan Baral, https://themes.gohugo.io/aafu/, licensed under MIT. You can still see the hangovers of this theme. I definitely prefer how my site looks now).

Flash-forward six months. I wanted to update something. Something _tiny_. Easy, surely? I made the change, and then ran Hugo. It absolutely pissed errors. So many errors. "Maybe there's an mistake in my template syntax?", I wondered naively. Alas, the only mistake I had made was using Hugo. There had been some major API change or something. I spent approximately 30 minutes trying to fix it before becoming frustrated and despondent. 

Then it hit me - I'm a computer scientist! In _theory_, I can code. Why not just code it up by hand? So I set out, effectively doing a clean room reimplementation of the Hugo-generated site, and within a relatively short amount of time, I had a finished product. A beautiful, one-page website, my mug plastered across it, in pure HTML, CSS, Javascript.
