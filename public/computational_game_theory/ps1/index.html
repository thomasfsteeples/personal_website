                <h2>Exercise 1: Lexicographic Preferences</h2>
                <p>Recall the example of lexicographic preferences from the lecture. The attributes are colour, engine
                    type, and nationality, with the ranking,
                    \begin{equation*}
                    \text{colour}> \text{engine} > \text{nationality}
                    \end{equation*}
                    The ordering for each of attribute is:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>colour</em>: \(\text{red} \pref \text{blue} \pref \text{green}\)</li>
                    <li><em>engine type</em>: \(\text{electric} \pref \text{petrol} \pref \text{diesel}\)</li>
                    <li><em>nationality</em>: \(\text{German} \pref \text{French} \pref \text{UK}\)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Define a utility function that takes three inputs (colour, engine
                    type, and nationality) and gives as output a real number, such that
                    this utility function corresponds to the preference ordering defined
                    above. <em>Don't</em> do this by enumerating all 27 cases! Argue for
                    the correctness of your function.

                <h2>Exercise 1: Solution</h2>
                <p>
                    Define
                    \begin{align*}
                    U(\text{red})=U(\text{electric})=u(\text{German})&=2
                    \\
                    U(\text{blue})=U(\text{petrol})=u(\text{French})&=1
                    \\
                    U(\text{green})=U(\text{diesel})=u(\text{UK})&=0
                    \end{align*}
                    Then, define
                    \[
                    u(x,y, z) = 100*U(x) + 10*U(y) + U(z)\text,
                    \]
                    where \(x\in\set{\text{red},\text{blue},\text{green}}\),
                    \(y\in\set{\text{electric},\text{petrol},\text{diesel}}\), and
                    \(z\in\set{\text{German},\text{French},\text{UK}}\).

                    Observe that for all \(x,x'\in\set{\text{red},\text{blue},\text{green}}\) with \(x\neq x'\), and
                    \(y,y'\in\set{\text{electric},\text{petrol},\text{diesel}}\) with \(y\neq y'\), and
                    \(z\in\set{\text{German},\text{French},\text{UK}}\) we have that: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>\(|U(y)-U(y')|>U(z)\), and, </li>
                    <li> \(|U(x)-U(x')|>U(y)+U(z)\).</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Exercise 2: Impossibility of Existence of Utility Representations</h2>
                <p>To make things simple in the lectures, we assumed our set of outcomes \(\Omega\) was finite.
                    Let’s now look at an example where this is not the case. Let the set of outcomes \(\Omega\) be
                    \(\mathbb{R}_+\times \mathbb{R}_+\).
                    Now define a preference relation \(\succeq\colon\Omega\times\Omega\) by:
                    \begin{equation*}
                    (x1,x2) \succeq(y1,y2) \quad\text{iff}\quad x1>y1 \,\text{or}\, [x1 =y1 \,\text{and}\, x2 \geq y2]
                    \end{equation*}
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Prove that the relation \(\succeq\) defined in this way is indeed a properly defined preference
                        relation.</li>
                    <li>Prove that there can exist no utility function \(u : \Omega\to\mathbb{R}\) representing
                        \(\succeq\).</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    (It may be useful to note that between any two distinct real numbers
                    there lies a rational number.)

                <h2>Exercise 2: Solution</h2>
                <p>
                    For the first part, we have to prove that \(\succeq\) is total, reflexive, and transitive.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Exercise 2: Solution</h2>
                <h3>Totality</h3>
                <p>
                    Consider arbitrary \((x_1,x_2),(y_1,y_2)\in \mathbb{R}_+\times\mathbb{R}_+\). By totality of
                    \(\geq\)
                    on \(\mathbb{R}_+\), either \(x_1>y_1\), \(y_1>x_1\), or \(x_1=y_1\).
                    If the former, \((x_1,x_2)\succeq (y_1,y_2)\).
                    If \(y_1>x_1\), immediately \((y_1,y_2)\succeq (x_1,x_2)\).
                    If \(x_1=y_1\), either \(x_2\ge y_2\) or \(y_2>x_2\). If \(x_2\ge y_2\), then \((x_1,x_2)\succeq
                    (y_1,y_2)\).
                    If \(y_2>x_2\), also \(y_2\ge x_2\), and it follows that \((y_1,y_2)\succeq (x_1,x_2)\).
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Exercise 2: Solution</h2>
                <h3>Reflexivity</h3>
                <p>
                    Consider arbitrary \((x_1,x_2)\in \mathbb{R}_+\times\mathbb{R}_+\). Then, both \(x_1=x_1\) and
                    \(x_2\ge x_2\). It follows that \((x_1,x_2)\succeq (x_1,x_2)\).
                </p>

            <section>
                <h2>Exercise 2: Solution</h2>
                <h3>Transitivity</h3>
                <p>
                    Consider arbitrary \((x_1,x_2),(y_1,y_2),(z_1,z_2)\in \mathbb{R}_+\times\mathbb{R}_+\) such that we
                    have
                    \((x_1,x_2)\succeq(y_1,y_2)\) and \((y_1,y_2)\succeq(z_1,z_2)\).
                    We distinguish four cases:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>\(x_1>y_1\) and \(y_1>z_1\),</li>
                    <li>\(x_1>y_1\), \(y_1=z_1\) and \(y_2\ge z_2\),</li>
                    <li>\(x_1=y_1\), \(x_2\ge y_2\), and \(y_1>z_1\),</li>
                    <li>\(x_1=y_1\), \(x_2\ge y_2\), \(y_1=z_1\), and \(y_2\ge z_2\).</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    In the first three cases, we have \(x_1>z_1\) and hence \((x_1,x_2)\succeq(z_1,z_2)\).
                    In the fourth case, we have \(x_1=z_1\) and \(x_2\ge z_2\). Accordingly,
                    \((x_1,x_2)\succeq(z_1,z_2)\), as
                    desired.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Exercise 2: Solution</h2>
                <p>For the second part, we proceed with proof by contradiction. So assume there exists such a function.
                    Thus, for all \((x_1, x_2), (y_1, y_2) \in \mathbb{R}_+ \times \mathbb{R}_+\), we have \(u(x1, x2)
                    \geq u(y_1, y_2)\) if and only if \(x_1, x_2 \succeq y_1, y_2\).</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Exercise 2: Solution</h2>
                <p>So for an arbitrary \(x\), we have \(u(x+1, 1) > u(x, 2) > u(x, 1)\). Thus, consider the set of
                    intervals,
                    \begin{equation*}
                    I = \{[u(x,1), u(x,2)] \mid x \in \mathbb{R}\}.
                    \end{equation*}
                    Every interval is non-empty, and every pair of intervals in \(I\) is disjoint. As every interval is
                    non-empty, it contains a rational number, \(q_x \in [u(x,1), u(x,2)]\). Define a mapping \(f :
                    \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{Q}\) by \(f(x) = q_x\). This mapping must be injective, as the intervals in
                    \(I\) are disjoint. But this implies the real numbers are countable, which is a contradiction.

                    You have three entertainment choices: football, pub, or rowing.
                    The utility you obtain from these will depend on whether it rains or
                    not. The utilities you get from these outcomes are as follows:
                </p>

                    You have a decision task ahead: to choose which activity to

                    football, and going to the pub. What are their corresponding expected utilities?
                    \begin{align*}
                    \text{EU}(F) &= 2 - p_{\mathit{rain}}, \\
                    \text{EU}(P) &= 3p_{\mathit{rain}}.
                    \end{align*}
                    We have \(\text{EU}(F) \geq \text{EU}(P)\) if and only if \(p_{\mathit{rain}} \leq \frac{1}{2}\). So
                    if the probability of it raining is less than \(\frac{1}{2}\), then you should go play football. If
                    it is greater than \(\frac{1}{2}\), then you should go down the pub. If it is exactly equal to
                    \(\frac{1}{2}\), then you are indifferent between the two possibilities.

                    By the independence axiom, for all loteries \(\ell\) and probabilities \(p \in (0, 1)\), we

                    \end{equation*}
                    This is true for all lotteries, so it is also true for \(\ell = B\), giving us,

                    Consider the following four lotteries with monetary rewards:

                    \ell_1 &= \left[\frac{1}{2} £100 + \frac{1}{2} £0\right] \\

                    \ell_3 &= \left[\frac{1}{20} £100 + \frac{19}{20} £0\right] \\

                    Now suppose I claim that my preferences satsify both \(\ell_2 \succ \ell_1\) and
                    \(\ell_3 \succ \ell_4\). Show that my preferences in this case do not satisfy the Von

                    The property does hold:

                    By transitivity of \(\succeq\), we obtain:

                    \end{equation*}

                    \end{align*}
                    The expected utility of the lottery would thus be bounded by \(2\).
                    This would correspond to a monetary value of \(£ 4\).

                    Consider the following two lotteries:
                    \begin{align*}
                    \ell_1 &= £50,\\
                    \ell_2 &= \frac{1}{2} £0 + \frac{1}{2} £100.
                    \end{align*}
                    Second lottery have greater expected monetary value, but first has great expected utility with
                    regard to the logarithmic utility.

                    In the second world war, a US bomber squadron was based 3000km from
                    their target. The target was so far away that fighter plane escorts
                    were impossible, making missions even more than usually dangerous.
                    Planes could only carry a few bombs on each mission, so that they
                    could carry enough fuel to return to base. Pilots were scheduled to
                    fly 30 missions before returning to the USA, but on average only
                    half of the pilots survived all 30 missions.

                    Logistics experts came up with the following proposal. Each plane
                    would carry a much heavier bomb load -- but only enough fuel to fly
                    one way. Thus, each mission would be a suicide mission. However, the
                    increased bomb load would mean that far fewer missions would be
                    needed, allowing 75\% of the pilots to return home. The other 25\%
                    of pilots, who had to fly the missions, would face certain
                    death. Those to fly the missions would be selected randomly.

                <p>
                    Every pilot who was presented with the new proposal rejected it in

                    Then we can model the setting as a decision problem under uncertainty

                    Now assume there are three outcomes, with associated preferences
                    as follows:
                    \begin{equation*}
                    \text{live with honour}\, \succ\, \text{die with honour}\, \succ\, \text{live without honour}
                    \end{equation*}
                    So: living with honour would mean flying a mission and surviving; to
                    die with honour would mean flying a mission and being killed; and
                    living without honour would mean living because somebody else had
                    flown a mission to certain death.

                    Reformulate the above scenarios as lotteries using these
                    preferences. For this case, does there exist a preference relation \(\succeq\) over lotteries
                    satisfying the von Neumann and Morgenstern axioms which is consistent with the pilot's
                    preferences?

                    Let \(\Omega'=\{\text{livehonour},\text{livenohonour},\text{deathhonour}\}\).
                    Then, let \(A'\) and \(B'\) be the scenarios such that
                    \begin{align*}

                    \end{align*}

                    The pilots do not necessarily violate the von Neumann Morgenstern axioms. To show this you have to
                    produce a model, in this case a preference relation over all lotteries over \(\Omega'\) that is
                    consistent with \(g(A')\succ g(B')\).

                    One solution is to define a utility function.
                    Let a utility function \(u\colon\Omega\to\mathbb R\) be given by
                    \begin{align*}
                    u(\text{livehonour}) & = 1\\
                    u(\text{deathhonour}) & =\textstyle \frac{1}{2}\\
                    u(\text{livenohonour})& = 0
                    \end{align*}
                    and assume the pilots' preferences over lotteries over \(\Omega\) be such that they prefer
                    those lotteries \(\ell\) that maximise the expected utility \(\text{EU}(\ell)\) with respect to this
                    utility
                    function. It can easily be appreciated that this is consistent with the preferences over the
                    outcomes \(\Omega\),
                    \[
                    \text{livehonour}\succ\text{deathhonour}\succ\text{livenohonour}\text.
                    \]
                    These preferences over lotteries over~$\Omega'$ also satisfy all the von Neumann-Morgenstern axioms.
