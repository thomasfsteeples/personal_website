                <h2>Exercise 1</h2>
                <p>
                    Consider two simple games \(G^1 = (A, v^1)\) and \(G^2 = (A, v^2)\) with the same set of players
                    \(A\). Suppose that a player \(i \in A\) is not a null player in both games. Can we conclude that
                    \(i\) is not a null player in the game \(G^\cap = (A, v^\cap)\), with the characteristic function
                    \(v^\cap\) given by
                    \begin{equation*}
                    v^\cap(C) = \min\{v^1(C), v^2(C)\}?
                    \end{equation*}
                </p>
                <p>
                    What about the game \(G^\cup = (A,
                    v^\cup)\), where \(v^\cup\) is given by \begin{equation*}
                    v^\cup = \max\{v^1(C), v^2(C)\}?
                    \end{equation*}
                </p>

                <h2>Exercise 1: Solution</h2>
                <p>
                    Neither conclusion can be drawn. We show this by producing two games, \(G^1, G^2\), in which there
                    exists a player who is not a null player, but is a null player in \(G^\cap / G^\cup\).

                    In class, we proved that a superadditive simple game has a non-empty core if and only if it has a
                    veto player. We also claimed that the following corollary holds: a payoff vector \((x_1, \ldots,
                    x_n)\) is in the core of a superadditive simple game \(G = (N, v)\) if and only if \(x_i = 0\) for
                    each player \(i\) who is not a veto player. Prove this corollary.

                    Suppose \(i \in N\) is not a veto player, and let \(\boldsymbol{x}\) be a core payoff allocation. As
                    \(i\) is not a veto player, there must exist some coalition \(S \subseteq N \setminus \{i\}\) such
                    that \(v(S) = 1\). Since \(\boldsymbol{x}\) is in the core, we must have \(\boldsymbol{x}(S) \geq
                    1\). Additionally, given that \(\boldsymbol{x}(N) = 1\), we must have \(\boldsymbol{x}(N) -
                    \boldsymbol{x}(S) = 0\). Thus, the payoff for all players outside of \(S\) is \(0\) - since \(i
                    \not\in S\), we have \(x_i = 0\).

                <p>
                    Conversely, suppose we have a payoff vector \(\boldsymbol{x}\) in which all non-veto players receive
                    a payoff of \(0\). We aim to show that this allocation lies in the core, i.e., we have for all \(C
                    \subseteq N\),
                    \begin{equation*}
                    \boldsymbol{x}(C) \geq v(C).
                    \end{equation*}
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since \(\boldsymbol{x}(N)=1\), some players must receive a positive payoff. These players cannot be
                    the non-veto players, so the sum of payoffs to the veto players under \(\boldsymbol{x}\) is 1. Now,
                    for any winning coalition \(C \subseteq N\), all veto players must be contained in \(C\), so we have
                    \(\boldsymbol{x}(C) = v(C) = 1\), and so \(\boldsymbol{x}\) is a stable payoff division. For any
                    losing
                    coalition, we must have \(V(C) = 0\), and so the core condition is satisfied automatically.
