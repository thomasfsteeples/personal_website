                    Either prove or disprove each of the following statements in the
                    context of \(2 \times 2\) games (disproving is usually best done with a counter-example).

                    True or false: If a player \(i\) has a dominant strategy in a game, then in every
                    Nash equilibrium of that game player \(i\) will choose a dominant
                    strategy.

                <p>
                    False. In the following game \((B,R)\) is a Nash equilibrium although \(B\)
                    and \(R\) are
                    not dominant strategies. Moreover, \(T\) and \(L\) are (weakly) dominant.</p>

                    Observe that the claim does hold, if a player has a strategy that <em>strictly</em> dominates all
                    others, as she can always deviate to this strictly dominant action.

                <p>
                    True or false: If a game has a dominant strategy equilibrium, then it is
                    unique: the game has no other dominant strategy equilibria.

                    False. In the following game every strategy is (weakly) dominant and every
                    strategy profile
                    a dominant strategy equilibrium.

                    \((B,R)\) is also a Nash
                    equilibrium even though \((T,L)\) is the only dominant strategy equilibrium. Again, observe an
                    outcome in which all players play a strictly dominant strategy, i.e., a strategy that strictly
                    dominates all other strategies of that player, will be unique.

                <p>
                    True. We prove the contrapositive. Assume we have a strategy profile that is <em>not</em> a Nash
                    equilibrium. Then, there is a player \(i\) and a strategy \(\sigma_i^\prime\in\Sigma_i\) such that
                    \begin{equation*}
                    u_i(\vec\sigma_{-i},\sigma'_i)>u_i(\vec\sigma)\text.
                    \end{equation*}
                    Hence, \(\sigma_i\) is <em>not</em> a dominant strategy and so
                    \(\vec\sigma=(\sigma_1,\sigma_2)\) is <em>not</em> a dominant strategy equilibrium.

                    True. Assume that \(\omega\) maximises utilitarian social welfare and, for contradiction
                    that \(\omega\) is <em>not</em> Pareto efficient. Then there is an outcome \(\omega^\prime\) such
                    that
                    \(u_i(\omega')\ge u_i(\omega)\) for all agents \(i\) and \(u_j(\omega')>u_j(\omega)\) for some agent
                    \(j\).
                    It follows that

                    Here the outcome \(TL\) with payoffs \((1,2)\) is Pareto efficient but obviously does not maximise
                    utilitarian social welfare.

                <p>
                    True, by the same argument as Exercise 1e. Assume that \(\omega\) maximises the product of agents'
                    utilities and, for contradiction that \(\omega\) is <em>not</em> Pareto efficient. Then there is an
                    outcome \(\omega'\) such that \(u_i(\omega')\ge u_i(\omega)\) for all agents \(i\) and
                    \(u_j(\omega')>u_j(\omega)\) for some agent \(j\). It follows that
                    \begin{equation*}

                    contradicting that \(\omega\) maximises the product of agents' utilities.

                <p>
                    True or false: If all utilities in a game are positive, then any Pareto
                    efficient outcome of the game will maximise the product of utilities
                    of players.

                    False. Again, counter-example is the game of Exercise 1f:

                <h3>Exercise 2: Nash equilibria in mixed strategies</h3>
                <p>
                    If we use mixed strategies in a game, then we are in the domain of expected utility. Write down an
                    expression for the expected utility of each player
                    in a generic \(2 \times 2\) game, when a mixed strategy is given as a pair
                    \((p,q) \in [0,1]^2\). That is, define the expressions
                    \(\mathit{EU}_1(p,q)\) and \(\mathit{EU}_2(p,q)\).
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Exercise 2a: Solution</h3>
                <p>
                    Suppose player 1 has strategies \(\text{T}\) and \(\text{B}\), and player 2 has strategies
                    \(\text{L}\) and \(\text{R}\). Moreover, suppose player 1 plays \(\text{T}\) with probability \(p\)
                    and player 2 plays \(\text{L}\) with probability \(q\). Then for \(i \in \{1, 2\}\), we have,
                    \begin{align*}
                    \text{EU}_i(p,q) &= pq u_i(\text{TL}) \\ &+ p(1-q) u_i(\text{TR}) \\ &+ (1-p)q u_i(\text{BL}) \\ &+
                    (1-p)(1-q)u_i(\text{BR}).
                    \end{align*}

            <section>
                <h3>Exercise 2b</h3>
                <p>
                    Generalise the expression you obtained in the first part to \(n\) player games, where each player
                    \(i \in N\) has pure strategy set \(\Sigma_i\). Denote a mixed strategy profile by
                    \(\vec{\mathit{ms}} = (\mathit{ms}_1, \ldots, \mathit{ms}_n)\), where \(ms_i \in \Delta\Sigma_i\) is
                    a mixed strategy for \(i\), i.e., a
                    probability distribution over \(\Sigma_i\). Use
                    \(\mathit{ms}_i(\sigma)\) to denote the probability of \(\sigma \in \Sigma_i\) being played in the
                    mixed strategy \(\mathit{ms}_i\).
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Hint:</em> First define an expression \(P(\vec{\sigma},\vec{ms})\), meaning the probability that
                    the pure
                    strategies \(\vec{\sigma}\) are chosen
                    given the mixed strategy profile \(\vec{ms}\). Then define expected utility using this expression.
                </p>

            <section>
                <h3>Exercise 2b: Solution</h3>
                <p>
                    First define,
                    \begin{equation*}
                    P(\vec{\sigma},\vec{ms}) = \prod_{j\in N}ms_j(\sigma_j)
                    \end{equation*}
                    Then the generalised expression for expected utility can be given by,
                    \begin{equation*}
                    EU_i(\vec{ms}) =
                    \sum_{\vec\sigma\in\vec\Sigma}P(\vec{\sigma},\vec{ms})u_i(\vec \sigma)
                    \end{equation*}
                    Writing things out fully, the generalised expression would look like this:
                    \begin{equation*}
                    EU_i(\vec{ms})=
                    \sum_{\vec\sigma\in\vec\Sigma}\left(\prod_{j\in N}ms_j(\sigma_j)\right)u_i(\vec \sigma).

                <h3>Exercise 4: Mixed Nash equilibria and the indifference principle</h3>
                <p>
                    This question refers to the "generic" \(2\times 2\) game that we
                    discussed in the lecture, where the row player has pure strategies
                    \(T\) and \(B\), and the column player has strategies \(L\) and \(R\).
                    Prove that a pair of probabilities \((p,q) \in (0,1)^2\) is a mixed
                    strategy Nash equilibrium in the generic \(2 \times 2\) game iff:
                    \begin{align*}
                    \text{EU}_1(T,q) & = \text{EU}_1(B,q) \quad \text{and,} \\
                    \text{EU}_2(L,p) & = \text{EU}_2(R,p)

                <p>
                    First assume that
                    \begin{equation*}
                    \text{EU}_1(T,q) = \text{EU}_1(B,q).
                    \end{equation*}
                    We aim to show that player \(1\) does not want to deviate to any other pure or mixed strategy. To
                    this end consider an arbitrary \(p'\in[0,1]\). Then we have,
                    \begin{align*}
                    \text{EU}_1(p,q)
                    & = p\text{EU}_1(T,q) + (1-p)\text{EU}_1(B,q) \\

                    & = p'\text{EU}_1(T,q) + (1-p')\text{EU}_1(B,q) \\
                    & = \text{EU}_1(p',q)\text.

                <p>
                    It follows that player \(1\) does not want to deviate from mixed strategy \(p\). The argument for
                    the second player is analogous and we may conclude that \((p,q)\in(0,1)^2\) is a fully mixed Nash
                    equilibrium.

                <p>
                    For the forward direction, assume that \((p,q)\in(0,1)^2\) is a fully mixed Nash equilibrium and for
                    a contradiction, further suppose that,
                    \begin{equation*}
                    \text{EU}_1(T,q) \neq \text{EU}_1(B,q) \quad \text{or} \quad \text{EU}_2(L,p) \neq
                    \text{EU}_2(R,p).
                    \end{equation*}
                    WLOG, we may assume the former and that
                    \begin{equation*}
                    \text{EU}_1(T,q) > \text{EU}_1(B,q).

                    This implies that,

                    \text{EU}_1(p,q)

                    \end{align*}
                    meaning player 1 would be better off playing \(T\) with probability \(1\). Thus \((p,q)\) is
                    <em>not</em> a Nash equilibrium.

                    with at least one of these inequalities being strict.

                    The first constraint gives us \(P\le \frac{n}{n+3}\) and the second constraint gives us \(P\le
                    \frac{2n}{3(3+n)}\). As the first constraint is subsumed by the second constraint, we obtain \(P\le
                    \frac{2n}{3(n+3)}\).

                    Similarly, solving for firm Y, we obtain,
                    \begin{align*}
                    \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{n+4}{n+3}-P\right) &\ge \frac{2}{n+3} \quad \text{and,}\\
                    \frac{n+2}{n+3} -P &\ge \frac{2}{3}.
                    \end{align*}
                    Again, the second constraint subsumes the first constraint, and we get \(P\le \frac{n}{3(n+3)}\).

                    Suppose that \(n\) is fixed. Are there values of \(P\) such that \((\text{B}, \text{NB})\) or
                    \((\text{NB}, \text{B})\) is a Nash equilibrium?

                <p>
                    No. We have seen that, as long as \(P &lt; \frac{n}{n+3}\), for each firm the unique best response
                    to \(\text{B}\) is \(\text{B}\). Thus, a strategy profile where one player chooses \(\text{B}\) and
                    the other player chooses \(\text{NB}\) cannot be an equilibrium for \(0 \le P &lt; \frac{n}{n+3}\).
                    On the other hand, if \(P> \frac{2n}{3(n+3)}\), the unique best response to \(\text{NB}\) is
                    \(\text{NB}\), so for \(1\ge P>\frac{2n}{3(n+3)}\) a strategy profile where one player chooses
                    \(\text{B}\) and the other player chooses \(\text{NB}\) cannot be an equilibrium either. As the
                    union of these two ranges covers all of \([0, 1]\), the claim follows.
