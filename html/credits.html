	  </h2>

            <p>
                If you have found this page, then congrats! You're a nosy bastard who likes looking under the hood and
                kicking
                the tires in. I bet you've brought your own dipstick as well.
            </p>

            <p>
                How did I craft this glorious monument to hubris, I hear you say? I'm glad you asked. Originally, I had
                heard of this nifty static site generator called
		<a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo
		</a>. It was pretty
                cool! It was dead easy to get up and
                running, had a nice templating syntax. Beautiful. Easy. But most importantly, it worked! No faffing
                around with PHP or MySQL or any nonsense like that --- you could just upload the three files (or however
                many there were) to a server and, y'know, just
		<em>serve
		</em> them. I picked a
		<a
                  href="https://themes.gohugo.io/aafu/">theme
		</a> I liked (of which you can definitely still see the
                remnants of), and I was away.
            </p>

            <p>
              Flash-forward six months. I wanted to update something. Something
	      <em>tiny
	      </em>. Easy, surely? I made
                the
                change, and then ran Hugo. It absolutely pissed errors. So many errors. "Maybe there's an mistake in my
                template
                syntax?", I wondered naively. Alas, the only mistake I had made was using Hugo. There had been some
                major
                API
                change or something. I spent approximately 30 minutes trying to fix it before becoming frustrated and
                despondent.
            </p>

            <p>Then it hit me - I'm a computer scientist! In
	      <em>theory
	      </em>, I can code. Why not just code it up by
                hand?
                So I
                set
                out,
                effectively doing a clean room reimplementation of the Hugo-generated site, and within a relatively
                short
                amount
                of
                time, I had a finished product. A beautiful, one-page website, my mug plastered across it, in pure HTML,
                CSS,
              Javascript.
