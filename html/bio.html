                I work for TWS Partners, a game theory consultancy. Prior to this, I completed my DPhil at the University of Oxford, working on <em>quantitative rational verification</em>. Broadly, my research interests lie across logic, complexity and games, and in particular, their application to Artificial Intelligence.

              Outside of work, I enjoy cooking, trying to get an endless number of side projects off the ground, and playing <a href="https://lichess.org/@/tsteeples">chess</a> poorly.
