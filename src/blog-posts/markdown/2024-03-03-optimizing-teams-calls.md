# Optimising online meetings for viewer pleasure

I know, I know, I'm three years late to the party. But I've only recently converged on a video-call setup which I'm pleased with.

## What we're working with

I have the benefit/privilege of working almost exclusively from home which means I spend two thirds of my waking hours in a cosy 

## Laptop webcam and microphone

Picture this: it's 2021 and you've just ordered a Dell XPS 15 (9510). It's got an 11th Gen Intel i7 processor, with 16 cores, an Nvidia 3050 Ti Laptop GPU, 32GB of memory and a sweet, sweet, sweet 16:10, 3840x2400 display. If I wasn't already taken, I'd be asking the ladies to form an orderly queue. 


Oh. God. 

What is this image? I grew up in the '00s, where 

## Upgrading to a USB webcam

Ah, the Logitech C920. It's twelve years old now. 

## Upgrading to a USB microphone

I bought a TKGOU UM6 USB microphone in the hope that it would help people appreciate my deep bassy tones a bit more (spoiler alert: it turned out the microphone wasn't the problem of my deep bassy tones). 

## Upgrading my lighting

I live in Oxford, a city revered for its beauty and historical character. It unfortunately suffers from being in the United Kingdom, a cold, drab place.

As my desk is facing the window, I am facing away from the light source above my head

## Lessons learnt and concluding remarks

After , the main question that comes to mind is "was it worth it?". Reactions from my colleagues have ranged from "Wow, your picture quality is amazing" to "Have you done something with your lighting?" to mute ambivalence. If we're being honest with one another, it's about 95% of that last category. 

However, this was 

The route I showed from video conferencing zero to hero wasn't as straightforward as I've presented:
- I tried using my iPhone as a webcam - whilst the picture quality was great, none of the software solutions I found could be reliably started on short notice. This may be different if you're using a MacBook, but I didn't have the best of luck with this on Windows. 
- I tried using my little FujiFilm X100F as a webcam - 
- I tried a condenser microphone (Samson C01) that I had inexplicably asked for for my 13<sup>th</sup> birthday, plugged into a Behringer UMC22 USB audio interface. It sounded good, but not noticeably so  

In terms of improving your online video calls, I think the following tips sit in the right place of cost-effectiveness:

- Use a wired internet connection: financial cost is super low
- Buy a USB microphone
- Put a soft lamp at a 45 degree angle to your face
